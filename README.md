# 3DP-DriveTrain
A Fully 3D Printed FTC Drivetrain

----

# WHY???

The reason behind this project is my dream for a good, customisable, and strong drivetrain. Whenever it is brought up, it usualy leads to immidiate dismissal, so this is to prove to all teams that a 3D Printed chassis is a good choice for a chassis. This proves that 3D printing is strong enough to compete with aluminum, light enough to compete with carbon fiber, and more versitle than either.

# What

This is A drivetrain using 3d printed parts wherever possible. It is compatable with the gobilda architecture for connecting to most of their standard products (eg. viper slides)


- It can be easily adjusted to almost sny situation, and is incredibly easy to add parts and modules to. 
- works in 3 dimensions, unlike traditional parallel plate designs
- Easy to design around, This is not limited to a single season, it can be addaped to almost any game with a few hours of CAD.
- Mounting, Top rails for any modules immaginable, grids on wass for anything form team markers, odo pods, to linear slides
- Incredibly light, uses around 1kg of filament for an entire chassis

#FEA(AKA. Finite Element Analisis (AKA. Find Weak Points))

This was the most improtant part of this project, it provided the evidence I needed to show that this was a viable option.
The incredible rigidity of PLA is acctualy crucial to this, as other filaments would deform under lesser pressures, so it is the ideal material in this case.
